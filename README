This is an experiment.  I am trying to organize my digital life
and part of that means keeping track of files.  I could use a
service like DropBox, or just a removable drive.  However:

  (a) I want to own as much of this as possible,
      for personal reasons, and

  (b) The metadata is very important.
      Specifically: tagging is very important.

If you find this code and want to run it, I have enclosed the
Docker Compose recipe that I use.  It depends on the upstream PHP
image (Apache flavor).  For the most part, though, that image is
just an artifact of convenience - any mod_php installation should
do just fine.

There is no authentication on this application.  Run it in
production at your own peril.
